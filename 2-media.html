          Watercolor is made by combining finely ground pigment in a water-soluble binder that distributes 
          pigment particles to create a uniform solution and adheres it to the support. It 
          is most commonly applied with a brush and water to paper, which is typically white. The brightness of
          the underlying support contributes to the jewel-like quality of the transparent colors. Watercolor paper is
          usually treated with gelatin sizing to prevent the paint from penetrating the sheet and allows for more
           precise brushwork.
          
<br><br>
I first started taking watercolor classes at a local university's extension program in 2007. Over the years, I learned to work with this medium, which is both forgiving and 
unforgiving at the same time.  It is a transparent medium that can be layered to achieve luminosity 
and increased color saturation.  Various effects can be achieved depending on whether the paper is 
wet or dry, how much water has been added to the paint, and the type of brush with which the watercolor paint is
applied.  
<br><br>
I use the Winsor & Newton Professional Watercolour range for its brilliance, transparency, and 
lightfastness.  I paint on Arches 100% cotton cold-pressed watercolor paper for its texture and 
resistance to repeated working and layering.  This paper is mould-made and gelatin-sized to prevent
 paint from penetrating into the paper and to improve the paper's workability.  My favorite watercolor brushes 
 to paint with are Robert Simmons White Sable synthetic brushes, which have a nice spring and keep a fine point when wet.

          Soft pastels are composed of kaolin, a type of clay, finely ground pigment, and a very small amount of
          binder. These ingredients are combined and rolled into sticks of colored powder that have to be hard enough
          to hold their shape, yet soft enough to crumble when stroked across a page. The surface to which it is applied
          must have a slight texture, or "tooth", to grab and hold the pastel on the surface. Soft pastels 
          are available in soft pastel sticks, in pans that can be applied with a sponge-like 
          tool, and as harder pastel pencils.
<br><br>
          A pastel painting's optical vibrancy is the result of both the absence of yellowing resins in its composition and
          the reflection of light from the multiple facets of the finely ground powder.  Unlike watercolor, it is an opaque
          medium that does not depend on the underlying brightness of the paper to impart luminosity.
<br><br>
          This medium is the one I have come to learn most recently, and despite the relatively 
          short amount of time I have been working with them, I have to say they are my favorite 
          media to work in.  The vibrancy of color, ability to layer, and the tactile experience 
          of working with them when blending has made them my most enjoyable medium. 
          <br><br>
          I use Rembrandt soft pastels for the majority of my work.  They are a medium-hard pastel 
          that are hard enough to create sharp details yet soft enough to blend easily.  Unison pastels
           are very soft, and I often use them over top of Rembrandt pastels to create highlights and
            accents.  For the finest details, I use Faber-Castell Pitt pastel pencils.  Although there
             are many pastel surfaces available, my favorite is Pastelmat.  This cellulose support has
              a velvet-like texture that is less abrasive than sanded paper, yet has enough tooth to 
              accept multiple layers of pastel.
